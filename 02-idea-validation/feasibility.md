# Technical Feasibility

## Overview
The project aims to build an intelligent research agent powered by the Perplexity API (Sonar). The system will assist users in asking complex questions, performing deep reasoning, and presenting accurate, human-like responses contextualized through real-time web data.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **APIs:** Perplexity Sonar API (reasoning + retrieval modes)  
- **Database:** Supabase  
- **Additional Tools:** Vercel for frontend deployment, Cloudflare for CDN and API routing

## Feasibility Evaluation
1. **API Integration:** Perplexity API provides reasoning, chaining, and multi-step querying. It fits perfectly with our systemâ€™s architecture.
2. **Performance:** The Sonar API handles complex reasoning with low latency; our backend performs lightweight orchestration.
3. **Scalability:** With modular frontend/backend design, the app can scale to educational tools, research assistants, and enterprise AI dashboards.
4. **Risks:** Potential rate-limiting and pricing uncertainty post-hackathon; can be mitigated via caching strategy and offline data modules.

## Conclusion
Technically, the project is highly feasible. The Perplexity API provides the cognitive layer, while Supabase and FastAPI provide extensibility for future real-world use cases.
