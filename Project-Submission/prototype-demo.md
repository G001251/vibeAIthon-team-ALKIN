📋 Project Overview
Humanet is an AI-powered HR Intelligence Platform designed to automate and streamline recruitment workflows for small and medium enterprises. Built during [Hackathon Name], this platform addresses real-world HR pain points validated through interviews with HR managers from Cavin Infotec and Stanco Solutions, Coimbatore.

🎯 Problem Statement
Through discussions with HR professionals from leading companies in Coimbatore, we identified critical challenges:

Key Problems Validated:
⏱️ Manual Resume Screening is Time-Consuming: HR teams spend 40+ hours/week manually reviewing resumes

🎯 Poor Candidate-Job Matching: Difficulty finding candidates with the right skills and project experience

💰 Lack of Salary Intelligence: No data-driven salary benchmarking tools for fair compensation

📧 Communication Delays: Slow feedback loops between HR and candidates

📊 No Centralized Analytics: Limited visibility into hiring funnel metrics

Quote from HR Interview:

"We lose valuable time and great talent due to manual screening processes. We need intelligent automation that doesn't replace human judgment but enhances it."
— HR Manager, Cavin Infotec Pvt Ltd
