# Problem Statement – Team ALKIN

## Background
In today’s competitive corporate environment, HR departments face several operational challenges in managing large volumes of employee data, payroll, and performance metrics.

## Identified Problems (after consulting with real HR professionals)
During in-person discussions with HR teams from local organizations, we identified the following recurring pain points:

1. **Manual Data Handling:** Employee attendance, payroll, and performance data are still maintained in spreadsheets, leading to frequent errors and time loss.
2. **Lack of Unified System:** Existing HR tools are fragmented — separate platforms for recruitment, payroll, and analytics make management inefficient.
3. **Limited Analytical Insights:** HRs struggle to generate salary and performance analytics quickly to support decision-making.
4. **Recruitment Mismatch:** Hiring teams face challenges in filtering resumes and identifying the right candidates for open roles.
5. **Unfair or Inaccurate Salary Estimation:** Without AI support, salary predictions often lack data-backed fairness.

## Conclusion from HR Consultations
HR experts emphasized the need for:
- A **centralized, all-in-one HR dashboard** that combines employee data, salary analytics, and recruitment tracking.
- **AI-based recommendations** to assist in salary prediction and candidate-job matching.
- A system that **reduces manual effort** and provides actionable insights for higher management.
