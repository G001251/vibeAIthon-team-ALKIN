# Desirability Validation - Humanet HR Platform

**Objective:**  
To validate the need for Humanet, we studied real-world HR challenges and conducted interviews with HR professionals.

**Primary Validation:**  
- Interview with **MRS.Dorothy Hariprakash**, HR at Cavin Infotech Pvt Ltd, Coimbatore. __(about an 2.5hrs of discussion and conclusion)
- Discussed day-to-day HR processes, challenges, and pain points.  
- Observed inefficiencies in employee management, recruitment, and salary determination.

**Key Insights from Dorothy Hariprakash:**
